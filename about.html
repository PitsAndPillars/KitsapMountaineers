		Hi, my name is Eric Pitts and this is my first ever website. It is meant to be a mock sports organization website for educational purposes and ths use of CIS 155 at Olympic College.
	</p>
	<h1>
		V1
	</h1>
	<p>
  	In v1 I created a few pages and a css stylesheet. Within these pages I set the foundation for the navigation and incorporated some basic styling.
	</p>
	<h1>
		V2
	</h1>
	<p>
		In v2 I laid out how the webpages would be structured and did some graphic design to make the site stand out and be more consistently themed, I also split up my styling into separate layout and styling sheets.
	</p>
	<h1>
		V3
	</h1>
	<p>
  	For the third iteration of this site I created a scoreboard using a table, filled out the schedule table using flexboxes/containers, and made the site more mobile friendly by having a scalable navigation, responsive flexcontainer layout, and other minor details.
	</p>
	<h1>
		V4
	</h1>
	<p>
  	For the fourth version of this site, I added a form that collects potential players' details to be contacted for tryouts on the team page. I also added an embedded video to share the story of Roberto Clemente, one of the greatest humanitarians in sports history.
